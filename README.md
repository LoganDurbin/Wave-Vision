## Project Description
Wave Vision is a computer-vision app that takes live hand gestures and translates them to mouse actions. The main goal of this app is to assist users who have limited motor functions, which make them unable to use a mouse effectively or at all. Using a pre-existing module will allow us to create nodes on select points in a person's hand, which will then allow them to freely use their hand to do basic functions that a mouse would be capable of doing.
